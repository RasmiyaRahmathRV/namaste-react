IGNITING THE APP

        npm - package manager
        package.json (configuration for npm)
        2 types of dependancies -
            1. dev dependancies
            2. normal dependancies

        parcel - bundler (npm install -D parcel)  - (-D means dev dependancy used in development stage only)
        transitive dependancies - one package have other packages and those have other like dependancy tree (so when we install one it will install all)
        npx parcel index.html (npx is same as npm npm used to install and all and if we want to execute something then we need to use npx parcel {something})
        its better to use react as npm package than a cdn link (npm install react)

        when we build our project remember to remove main from package.json (npx parcel build index.html)

LAYING THE FOUNDATION

        npx parcel index.html (we no longer need this command as we are going to change the commands into npm 
            1. change package.json script into 
                "scripts": {
                    "start": "parcel index.html",
                    "build": "parcel build index.html",
                    "test": "jest"
                },

                we added start and build here so that we can access it through npm commands
                npx parcel index.html - npm run start/ npm start
                npx parcel build index.html - npm run build
            )


        as the create element is not developer friendly facebook dev created JSX as we can combine javascript and html together 
        
        const heading = React.createElement(
            "h1",
            {"id": "heading"},
            "Namaste React"
        );

        const jsxHeading = <h1>Namaste React using JSX </h1>

        babel inside parcel is transpiling the jsx to react
        {
            react.createElement => reactElement- JS object => HTMLElement
            JSX => react.createElement => reactElement - JS object => HTMLElement
        }


        JSX - is a camal case (className,tabIndex)

        React components
            1. class based component - old
            2. Functional component - new (normal javascript function which returns jsx)

        component composition - component inside component

        jsx will sanitize the data which is given so the malicious attacks will be stopped by jsx 
        JSX makes our webapp readable
