npm - package manager
package.json (configuration for npm)
2 types of dependancies -
    1. dev dependancies
    2. normal dependancies

parcel - bundler (npm install -D parcel)  - (-D means dev dependancy used in development stage only)
transitive dependancies - one package have other packages and those have other like dependancy tree (so when we install one it will install all)
npx parcel index.html (npx is same as npm npm used to install and all and if we want to execute something then we need to use npx parcel {something})
its better to use react as npm package than a cdn link (npm install react)

when we build our project remember to remove main from package.json (npx parcel build index.html)
